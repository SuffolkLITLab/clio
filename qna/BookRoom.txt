Q(1): How can I help you?
A: I need help booking a room in the clinic.
	Q(1.1): OK. The clinic has a total of 4 rooms available to be reserved for client meetings. There are two small interview rooms just off the student work area in suite 150, as well as a larger meeting room in suite 160 and one small client meeting room in suite 165. <p>To use an interview room, sign up in the notebook outside of the room - make sure to write your name and how long you plan to use the room for. <p>If you want to reserve the clinic library for any reason, speak to one of the front desk administrators.
	A: Great! Thanks.
