Q: What can I help you with?
A: I need to edit a matter.
	Q: OK. Type the name of the matter in the search bar and hit enter. This will take you to the matter's dashboard, which will look something like this: href="https://suffolklitlab.org/clio/images/MatterDashboard.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://suffolklitlab.org/clio/images/MatterDashboard.png"/></a> 
	A: OK, I've made it to the dashboard.
		Q: Great. Now, in order to edit the matter, click on the blue "Edit" button at the top right of the dashboard page. A new page will load and this is where you will be able to edit all the information in your matter. <p>Here, you can edit the status of the case, the attorney responsible for the case, edit contacts, add a brief case synopsis, change the supervisor, add the court Judge assigned to the case, add a docket number, etc. Make sure you check each section and add any information relevant to your case.
		A: I'm done editing the matter.
			Q: Once you're done adding information to your matter, click on the blue "Save matter" button at the bottom left of your screen. This will take you back to the matter dashboard where you can double check that all the information was entered correctly.
			A: Thanks!
