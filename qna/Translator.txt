Q(1): How can I help you?
A: I need help translating for a client.
	Q(1.1): First, you must consult with your clinical professor in order to determine the level of need for interpretation in a given case. <p>Questions to determine level of need include: Does the client understand some English? If so, how much? Can s/he understand enough to schedule an appointment?
	A: OK, I'll consult with my clinical professor. Is there anything else I should know beforehand?
		Q(1.1.1): We have some Spanish translators available onsite. Vivian Rosado, in suite 150, provides interpretation for the Health Law and Family Law Clinics. Ana Vaquerano, in suite 110, provides interpretation for Accelerator Practice and Immigration Clinics. Juvenile Defenders and Defenders Clinics utilize Court-provided interpreters, when available. <p>Students may request interpretation services directly from the staff member, provided they have pre-approval from their professor. You must provide the staff member adequate advanced notice (at least 24 hours) and provide an agenda for the meeting in advance.
		A: What about for non-Spanish translators?
			Q(1.1.1.1): All requests for non-Spanish interpretation must go to Professor Sarah Boonin for pre-approval and then to an outside translation service, if approved. Students requesting outside translation services must CC Joan Luke and their supervising professor, provide an estimate of the length and cost of the interpretation, and describe its necessity. <p><b>Only those interpretations necessary for the litigation will be approved.</b>
			A: OK, got it.
