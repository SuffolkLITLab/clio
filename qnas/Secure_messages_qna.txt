Q(Greeting): How may I help you today?
A: I would like to know how to send a secure message.
	Q(Clio): Great. To start, go to the communications page. You can navigate here through a client's matter or on the taskbar on the left side of the screen. <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/clio/images/Communication_1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://suffolklitlab.org/clio/images/Communication_1.png"/></a>
	A: Got it. What next?
		Q(first):Click on the blue Add secure message button on the upper right side of the page. A new window will pop up.<a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/clio/images/Communication_2.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://suffolklitlab.org/clio/images/Communication_2.png"/></a>
		A: Done. Tell me what to do now.
			Q(second):Type in the name of the matter related to the message in the first box or use the drop-down to select a matter. Under Contact, type in the recipient of the message. You will then need to type a subject in the subject box and your secure message in the body.
			A: Great! Can I attach a document?
				Q(third): Yes. At the bottom of the window, you will see an option to attach a document. Once all the fields are filled in, click the blue send message button to have your secure message sent.
				A: Understood. Is there anything I should know about secure messages?
					Q(1.1.1.1.1.1): One thing to understand about secure messages is how they are different from e-mails. Secure messages require a password to view and are protected by encryption. These messages also do not leave the Clio servers to ensure security. That is all for now.
