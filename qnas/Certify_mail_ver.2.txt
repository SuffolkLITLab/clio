Q(1): This should take only a minute to go through. First you will need the small green certified mail receipt form. This form will have a bar-code on the left side. You can find these forms in the clear bins in the clinic supplies area.
A: I have it. Now what?
	Q(1.1): Fill in the required information on the form including the recipient and the address the letter will delivered to.
	A: Cool, then what?
		Q(1.1.1): Remove the back of the receipt and stick the side with the bar-code over the top of the envelope. The back of the bar-code will have an adhesive for easy placement. The bar-code should also be to the right of the return address but should have enough space for a stamp.
		A: Got it! Tell me more.
			Q(1.1.1.1): If required, check off "receipt for merchandise" if you will need proof that the mail was received.
			A: Great! Anything else?
				Q(1.1.1.1.1): Keep record of the mailing by holding the receipt. After that, you are all clear.
				A: Awesome. I get it!
