Q(1): FYI, it can take a few days to arrange for a translator or interpreter. This walk through should only take 3-5 min. Do you need someone to translate a substantive document?
A: Yes
	Q(1.1): You'll need a translator. Speak with your supervisor. GOTO:end
A: No
	Q(1.2): Do you need Spanish translation for a simple letter or someone to interpret during an interview?
	A: Yes
		Q(1.2.1): Have you consulted with your supervisor to determine the level of need?
		A: Yes
			Q(translators): We have some Spanish translators available onsite: <p>Vivian Rosado, in suite 150, provides interpretation for the Health Law and Family Law Clinics. <p>Ana Vaquerano, in suite 110, provides interpretation for Accelerator Practice and Immigration Clinics. <p>Juvenile Defenders and Defenders Clinics utilize Court-provided interpreters, when available.<br><br>
After you get pre-approval from your supervisor, you may request interpretation services directly from one of these staff members. You must provide them at least 24 hours notice and an agenda for the meeting well in advance. Meetings cannot exceed two hours and shouldn't be over lunch. GOTO:end
		A: No
			Q(1.2.1.2): Keep in mind you'll need to do that before anything else. GOTO:translators
	A: No
		Q(1.2.2): All requests for non-Spanish interpretation must go to Professor Sarah Boonin for pre-approval and then to an outside translation service, if approved. Students requesting outside translation services must email Joan Luke and their supervising professor, provide an estimate of the length and cost of the interpretation, and describe its necessity. <br><br>
	<b>Only those interpretations necessary for the litigation will be approved.</b> GOTO:end
