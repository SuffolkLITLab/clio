Q(1): Hi! How may I help you today?
A: I would like to know how to mail a letter through the clinic.
	Q(1.1): Okay! Once you have your letter labeled with the proper recipient, you will want to drop the letter in the mailbox bin in clinic 150. This mail bin is for all first class mail.
	A: When will my mail be picked up?
		Q(1.1.1): Outgoing mail will be picked up in the morning during the mail drop. This will be before noon at Clinic 150 only.
	A: What if my letter requires special services? (return receipt, overnight delivery, certified mail, registered mail, etc.)
		Q(1.1.2): All mail that falls under special services must have a mail request form attached that is completely filled out. You must also bring this type of mail to 73 Tremont Mail Services Office, located across the street on the 2nd
Floor. The sender must be the person to bring this type of mail.
