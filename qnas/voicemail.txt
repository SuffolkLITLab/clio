Q(Greeting): How may I help you today?
A: I would like to know how to set up my voicemail.
	Q(vm): Okay. If you are setting up the voicemail from inside the clinic, you will need to dial 3000. If you are setting up the voicemail outside the clinic, you will need to dial 617-305-3000.
	A: Okay. Then what do I do?
		Q(1.1.1): Enter your mailbox number, which will be the last four digits of your phone number.
		A: Okay, done. What now?
			Q(1.1.1.1): Enter the security code 147258 once you have logged on to the voicemail system for the first time.
A: I would like to know how to access my voicemail mailbox.
	Q(1.2): I can help with that. First, call the voicemail internal or external number.
	A: Okay. What's next?
		Q(1.2.1): If the system asks for a mailbox number, press the pound key and enter the mailbox number. If the system does not ask for this, press star, pound and enter the security code instead of the mailbox number. If this is your first time using it, you may need to use the default code 147258.
		A: Understood. Thank you.
			Q(1.2.1.1): Have a great day! GOTO:home
