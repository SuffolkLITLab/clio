Q(1.1): Okay. First, you will need to enter the name of your new potential client along with all the key parties and/or witnesses
into Clio. You will then conduct a conflict check against other clients of the Clinical Programs. Once you have done this, you must submit the results of this conflict check in the case matter once it is opened.
A: Okay, is that all?
	Q(1.1.1): There is more. You must also check the names of the new client and key parties/witnesses against the
names in the "Conflict of Interest Form" from prior and current outside employment. The results from this must all be submitted in the case matter once it is opened.
	A: Got it. What else do I need to do?
		Q(1.1.1.1): Per the clinic student handbook, you must ask your colleagues who belong to the same clinic, to check the name of the new client and
key parties/witnesses against the lists of their past and present clients from prior work as shown in their "Conflict of Interest" forms. You must then submit the results of this conflict check in the case matter once it is opened.
		A: Great. Anything else?
			Q(1.1.1.1.1): Look at your Conflicts of Interest form, and enter all the names within that form into Clio. Submit the results of in the Conflicts Log in Clio.
			A: Then what?
				Q(1.1.1.1.1.1): Once you have performed these checks and find that they show potential conflicts, you must take the information to your supervising attorney to discuss an appropriate resolution to the conflict.
